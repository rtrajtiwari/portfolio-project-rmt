        <p>
            Hello! I am a Rajmohan Tiwari at IET DAVV, passionate about web development, graphic design, data analysis. 
            As I continue my academic journey, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world projects. 
            My studies have provided me with a strong foundation in  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and I am excited to keep learning and growing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I am still in the early stages of my career, I am committed to building a strong portfolio that showcases my progress and achievements. 
            I look forward to adding more projects and sharing my journey with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading, coding, playing sports and I believe that my diverse interests help me approach problems with creativity and enthusiasm.
